# filePuller
This is a python script that uses simple recursion to pull files and filenames out of nested folders of indeterminate and variable depth. It provides an output of all the filenames contained within folders, and also copies the files into a separate folder.

I wrote this script to solve a problem I had of needing to get both a list of the filenames that were contained in numerous separate folders. These files existed at the bottom of nested folders of both indeterminate and variable depth and quantity. This was a very tedious and manual process so I wrote this script to automate the most time consuming portion of the task.
